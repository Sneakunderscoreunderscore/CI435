				<h3>
					Developing a growth mindset
				</h3>
				<p>I have always had difficulty with taking risk and trying anything new, even starting uni I was scared becasue I had never done anything like it and theer was so much i didnt think i could do becasue I had never tried. But before long I started forcing myself to do more, changing my mindset from avoiding things i might not like to experimenting incase it becomes something I like.</p>
				<p>My journy of developing this mindset started with going to student society social events. I am not a very social person but slowly over the first few weeks I met people and started to feel comfortable and more confident. </p>
				<p>My next step was then trying some new food and drinks. Since I had become lactose intolorant a few months before comign to uni, I havent had any form of milkshake bacause I had never tried any plant based milks. However this changed when I was convinced to go to a cafe with one of my new friends and tried a vegan milkshake, and I loved it.</p>
				<p>After this there a few more notable parts that have helped to change and develop my mindset into more of a growth mindset, from making other people chose some food for me to installing arch linux on my laptop. Overall this has helped me boost my confidance in trying new things, and while I still need help to try some things i would say i have successfly build a significantly more growth oriented mindset than what I started uni with.</p>
